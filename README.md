# Overview

{Welcome to my BMR Calculator application! My intent with this project was to showcase my familiarity with the xcode development environment, the swift programming language, and apple's MVC design pattern'}

{BMR stands for basal metabolic rate, the number of calories you body burns per day at rest. Use the buttons and sliders to give the app your data and it will estimate your personal basal metabolic rate.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
